                <h4>Tuck Shop! What's that?</h4>
                <p>A tuck shop is a retail shop or space within or in close proximity to a school, hospital, apartment complex etc. that sells foods, provisions, groceries etc. to the students and those requiring such service. It was originally known for selling pastries, sweets and biscuits to school children, however today, the word "Tuck Shop" is loosely used to describe just about any store or food place including burger shops. Being a boarding only secondary school, <b> Shalom Science and Technology Academy (SSTAC)</b> found the need to provide a place where students, staff (resident and non-resident) as well as visiting guests/parents could refresh themselves and replinish any items they wish to. Therefore the tuck shop of SSTAC has become a preferred destination for the purchase of goods at your comfort and at the most affordable price. </p>

                <h4>Where are our fruits? SSTAC students ask</h4>
                <p>Students of Shalom Science and Technology Academy (SSTAC) have met with the director of administration to ask why they are unable to buy fruits especially the seasonal fruits. In a semi-formal gathering ably represented by some members of the 2024 school functionaries, the students appealed that there should be a steady supply of different fruits in the tuck shop to enable them buy. In agreement, the director of administration stated that, the benefits of fruits to the growth and development of our students cannot be over emphasized and therefore instructed the managing team of the tuck shop to make sure that we have supplies of fruits at least two different types twice a week. </p>

                <h4>Pastries...How we make our snacks in SSTAC</h4>
                <p>Students of our disruptive media team met up with the head chef of the pastry and snack department and in a brief chat discussed why snacks were made in house in SSTAC, what is the process of making these snacks and any challenges faced. 
                Students: Good Morning Chef.
                Chef: Good Morning Students.
                Students: Please Can you tell us why you decided to produce our snacks here in school instead of get them supplied?
                Chef: Well, let me start by saying that the decision to do that came from the school and I support it 100%. As you know, food safety and hygiene is very important, and the only way we could guarantee the quality, safety and hygiene of our snacks was to produce them here in school.
                Students: What are the processes involved in making these snacks?
                Chef:
                Students: Are there currently any challenges?
